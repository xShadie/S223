[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.3 Must-buy items
It is quite early to mention these items, but having a solid target will help you redirect:

*Titanshield

*Linen Belt
[COLOR=808476;X_PADDING=20]*Can be can be crafted at the Alchemist

The ones you receive in the beginning will not last forever, so you better start 
collecting money for these 3 permanent companions...

[COLOR=808476;X_PADDING=20]*Max. HP 2.000

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]4. Leveling Paths: 30Lv, 50Lv, 75Lv+

Here are the leveling paths which at the moment are the most viable and easy ways to level up yourself:

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 1 - Level 30
*Shinsoo
*Yajang

*Chunjo
*Bokjung

*Jinno
*Bakra

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 30 - Level 42
*Valley of Seungryong
*Spider Dungeon 1
*Spider Dungeon 2

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 42 - Level 61
*Mount Sohan
*Hwang Temple
*Spider Dungeon 2
*Spider Dungeon 3

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 61 - Level 81
*Ghost Woods
*Red Forest
*Spider Dungeon 3

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 81 - Level 90
*Red Forest 
*Grotto of Exile 1
*Grotto of Exile 2

Remember, pushing yourself to gain levels over dropping items is not always good. For example, 
taking your time and farming in Ghost Woods & Red Forest is preferred than leveling up
in Spider Dungeon, because Ghost Woods & Red Forest will be your yang-paradise at this point. 
This guide is all about "The Start", so let's not extend to further level paths for now...


[IMG=d:/ymir work/ui/wiki/divider_long.tga; Y=2230; CENTER_ALIGN]

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]5. How do I increase my damage?

At this point, your damage should start to bother you. 
You realise that time is money and you want the best result possible. 
Well, here's your guidance:

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.1 Aura of the Sword / Enchanted Blade L
If you're Sura Weaponry or Warrior Body, you want these 2 skills at the maximum stage. 
Which, surprisingly, is not P. Skills extend up to L (Legendary) and can be 
trained with Legendary Soulstones.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.2 Vote4Buff (20% Strength against Monsters)
Up to this point, 20% Experience bonus was really not bad. If you want to maximize your profits from metinstones, 
20% Strength against Monsters is your way to go...

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.3 Dragon Stone Alchemy
You should have enough Cor Draconis to start blending. Your goal for now is to make a 
Legendary Dragon Ruby (Excellent)+6, with at least 15% Average Damage, 120 Attack Value & Defense. Work on it...

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.4 Sash with at least 13% Average Damage
A sash would fit perfect on you, it's true. Start searching for one with at 
least 13% Averag Damage and +3 Strength to improve your damage.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.5 Rune System (F5)
The Rune System is a complex one and is described thoroughly in another guide. Although, in a sum, 
it provides you with 20% PvE bonuses & status points that you are surely intrested. Take a look.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.6 Dews
Dews manufactoring is a big aspect of the game and you should definitely try at Huahn-So. 
Later on, you can use these dews to produce the permanent versions of them.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]6. My first dungeons

You might be thinking that you are nowhere near a dungeon, right? Wrong! You can start completing dungeons 
from as early as 30Lv. Orc Maze, Spider Baroness & Devil's Catacombs are some casual dungeons to start with. 
Make sure to check for guides before you do so...

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]7. How to become a millionaire

At this point, there's a great chance that you're already a 'millionaire'. 
But what's going to make you rich enough in your early stages of the server? 
Well, there are surely some tips. Ghost Woods & Red Forest as mentioned before, 
is a yang-paradise for players around 85Lv. Why's that? Because you can easily drop 
Emerald Crystals and Yang Coupons from metinstones. The Emerald Crystals are only 
droppable up until the 90Lv metinstones, so you're pretty much in the best map to farm them. 
They are sold in prices that will let you easily grab some Soul Crystal items and also make enough money
to craft/buy a good 75Lv weapon & other equipment for your future maps. A wise old man once said: 
Stay in Red Forest until you have all the must-buy items menntioned above. 
Then continue your adventures in the 90Lv+ maps. From now on, you can visit the guide 
'105 and what now?' to continue your adventures... Have fun!
